00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.759
A great way to learn a variety of

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:06.389
computer vision techniques is by building an image classifier.

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:08.744
A lot of what we'll focus on in this lesson,

00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:10.750
is grouping image data into classes;

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.734
like humans, bikes and cars,

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:15.660
or images taken during the day versus at night.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.155
And some of these classification tasks are quite challenging.

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:23.070
We'll be exploring two main ways to separate this data: by

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.612
programming explicit rules that separate data into groups,

00:00:26.612 --> 00:00:28.289
or by machine learning techniques,

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.019
that can automatically separate this data.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.500
Both approaches can be used to build an image classifier.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.859
So what exactly is an image classifier?

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.729
An image classifier is an algorithm that takes in an image as

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:46.064
input and outputs a label or a class that identifies that image.

00:00:46.064 --> 00:00:50.489
For example, one type of classifier used in self-driving cars will look at

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.840
different images of roads and be able to identify whether that road contains humans,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.200
cars, bikes and so on,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.370
distinguishing and classifying each image based on its contents.

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.799
And there are many types of classifiers used to recognize

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.117
specific objects or even behaviors like whether a person is walking or running.

00:01:09.117 --> 00:01:12.454
But all these classifiers involve a similar series of steps.

00:01:12.454 --> 00:01:16.564
I'll refer to these steps as part of the image classification pipeline.

00:01:16.564 --> 00:01:21.094
First, a computer receives visual input from an imaging device like a camera.

00:01:21.094 --> 00:01:25.189
This is typically captured as an image or a sequence of images.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.079
Each image is then sent through

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.159
some pre-processing steps whose purpose is to standardize each image.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.369
Common pre-processing steps include resizing an image,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.335
or rotating it to change its shape.

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:40.714
Or transforming the image from one color to another like from color to gray scale.

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:42.950
Only by standardizing each image,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.975
for example making them the same size,

00:01:44.974 --> 00:01:48.859
can you then compare them and further analyze them in the same way.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.019
Next, we extract features.

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:53.375
Features are what help us define certain objects.

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:56.674
And they're usually information about object, shape, or color.

00:01:56.674 --> 00:01:59.974
Some features that distinguish a car from a bicycle,

00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:02.689
are that a car is usually a much larger shape,

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.578
and it has four wheels instead of two.

00:02:05.578 --> 00:02:08.750
The shape and wheels would be distinguishing features for a car.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.949
And we'll talk more about features later in this lesson.

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:15.609
And finally these features are fed into a classification algorithm,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.626
also referred to as a model,

00:02:17.626 --> 00:02:19.641
that classifies the image.

00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:21.310
This step looks at any features from

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.150
the previous step and predicts whether say this image is of a car,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.640
or a pedestrian, or a bike and so on.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.439
You'll be programming each of

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:33.534
these classification steps manually so that you really understand each step.

00:02:33.534 --> 00:02:35.365
And by the end of this lesson you'll have

00:02:35.365 --> 00:02:38.200
all the skills you'll need to complete the final project,

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.379
building a traffic light classifier which takes in images of

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.740
traffic lights and separates them into three classes: red,

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.659
yellow, or green lights.
