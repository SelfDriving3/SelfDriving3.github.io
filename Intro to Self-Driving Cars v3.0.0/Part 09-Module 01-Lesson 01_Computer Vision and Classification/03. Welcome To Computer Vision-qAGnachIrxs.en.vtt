00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.003
You've been building up a solid foundation of programming and data analysis skills.

00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:07.500
And in this section, I'm excited to introduce you to

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.590
one more self-driving car tool, computer vision.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.450
Computer vision is how machines,

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.140
like self-driving cars, visually perceive the world and respond to it.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.090
Imagine that you're driving a car.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.890
You have to use your senses to notice pedestrians,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.800
other cars, bicyclists, and all the road and traffic markings around you.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.060
This is similar to how a self-driving car sees the world.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.390
It gathers data through cameras and other sensors and then

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.190
uses that input to safely navigate and move through the world.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.710
In this lesson, we'll learn about common computer vision techniques that are

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.970
used to analyze camera images and extract important information from them,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.610
like the color or shape of different objects.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.290
We'll also briefly talk about

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.800
machine learning and how it's used in combination with computer vision

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.170
to give machines away to learn from data and

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.450
recognize patterns in images. Let's get started.
