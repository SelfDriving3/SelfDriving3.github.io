00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.380
I have three things that I love in my life,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.380
which is games, communication and cars.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.745
Self-driving cars for me, it's an X-ray thing.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.780
So there's already self-driving cars on the road today.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.460
I drive in one every day and I'd have to say,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.320
I can never go back.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.925
Is something very magical, right about software controlling a two ton vehicle.

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:27.545
I think that one thing that I would be really excited about,

00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:33.480
is being able to build autonomous vehicles for space exploration.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.765
Then I heard about the self-driving Car Nanodegree and I signed up right away.

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:43.105
There's a huge talent shortage in the self-driving car space.

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:45.860
All these companies doing development work and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.655
not enough engineers who are able to fill those roles.

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:52.790
Lessons really help me in the Udacity Course,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.465
jump into this industry and learn the basics of how everything works.

00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:58.490
It's all about building.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.050
You're not just learning in isolation.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.235
It's not just research,

00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:03.990
it's actual code that you're writing.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.500
We're working with over 200 different partners from card companies,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.195
truck company, shuttle companies,

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:14.150
software startups, as well as ride sharing services,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.980
who are all looking for talent that can help them bring their products to market.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.560
Self-driving cars to me at this, the ultimate product.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.270
It changes arguably the biggest market on the planet.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.420
It levels the playing field of individuals

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.585
to now have access to safe affordable, reliable transportation.

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:33.455
So when I think about what I want to spend the next decade or so of my life working on,

00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:36.560
moving a two ton vehicle around the world autonomously,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.970
ranks that at the very top.
