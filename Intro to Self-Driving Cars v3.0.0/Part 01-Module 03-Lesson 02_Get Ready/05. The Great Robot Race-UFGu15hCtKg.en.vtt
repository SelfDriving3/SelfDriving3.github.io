00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.254
In this race, there are no drivers.

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:06.760
No human behind the wheel.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.000
These robots are on their own.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.520
Their human observers can't even keep up.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.890
It's literally outrunning us.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.190
I don't know you can do it with this car. I can't keep up with this.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.120
It's the first race ever where the machine makes all the decisions.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.300
Think of it as a technology demonstration.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.390
It'll turn believers out of the nonbelievers.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.140
Behind each robot is a team of people,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.200
who sacrificed everything creating hardware

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.730
and software to attempt what's never been done before.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.060
If they put the blood,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.190
sweat, and tears into your vehicle to make it there.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.865
I work 16 hour days.

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:46.170
Seven days a week for months on end.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.400
The people that fell into this project get consumed by it.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.220
I even dream about it.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.910
Dreams will now be put to the test.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.625
It's winner take all with a $2 million prize,

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.090
but the stakes are much higher.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.220
Can a machine navigate miles of punishing desert terrain.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.610
The speed and agility of a human driver.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:44.520
Find out. The race begins, on NOVA.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.847
California Speedway, Mecca for NASCAR auto racing.

00:01:49.847 --> 00:01:52.825
In October of 2005,

00:01:52.825 --> 00:01:57.420
43 teams have brought their vehicles to compete in a unique event.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.345
A race driven not by testosterone, but computer code.

00:02:02.345 --> 00:02:04.365
These machines are robots,

00:02:04.365 --> 00:02:06.660
and they're going to run an obstacle course with

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.505
no one behind the wheel and no remote control.

00:02:11.505 --> 00:02:13.815
It's called the Grand Challenge.

00:02:13.815 --> 00:02:16.740
And for good reason, on a two mile course,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.980
these robots are on their own and there's plenty to trip them up.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.220
They'll encounter gates and tunnels and all kinds of obstacles including,

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.940
parked cars and hay bales.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.075
The competition comes in all shapes and sizes.

00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:38.350
The smallest robot is Ghostrider.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.090
Ladies and gentlemen, the world's first autonomous motorcycle,

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.670
Ghostrider approaching obstacle one.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:59.685
As though raised from the dead.

00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:03.890
Ghostrider bravery forges on.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.675
Now, the largest entry,

00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:18.295
a 16-ton truck called TerraMax approaches the first gate and hesitates.

00:03:18.295 --> 00:03:20.390
Come on baby, crank it, crank it, crank it.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.405
Do it, do it,

00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:24.220
do it, do it, no.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.385
Like anxious parents, its creators look on in agony,

00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:33.390
but all they can do is watch as TerraMax backs up and tries again.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.110
It's like a bull in a China shop. Come on.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:45.110
On the eighth pass,

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.430
TerraMax squeezes through the gate and heads for the finish.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.795
Tommy has a lovable retro appearance,

00:03:58.795 --> 00:04:01.010
but looks are a bit deceiving.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.494
A computer glitch turns the robot into a wild beast.

00:04:07.494 --> 00:04:12.350
There are no serious injuries but

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.848
Tommy is out of the competition.

00:04:17.848 --> 00:04:22.010
Team DAD has arrived from Silicon Valley with

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.100
a roof ornament that looks like a relic from an old disco.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.050
It's a homemade laser scanner,

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.300
created by Dave Hall and his brother Bruce.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.470
Even as they drive to the start,

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.790
they're writing computer code to make their scanner work.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.560
Now, it's show time.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.190
We want to watch the first one ready now. Which one's up?

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:53.200
Almost immediately, they hit the hay.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.020
For this run, Team DAD,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.708
like disco in the 70's, is dead.

00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:04.052
But they'll have another chance.

00:05:04.052 --> 00:05:09.565
Many universities are fielding teams and Stanley, Stanford's robot,

00:05:09.565 --> 00:05:16.940
looks like a high-tech version of another VW Herbie, The Love Bug.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.185
Stanley is the brainchild of Sebastian Thrun.

00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:25.640
For him the Grand Challenge is a Woodstock for Robo-Geeks.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.735
There's very little in the way of competitiveness.

00:05:27.735 --> 00:05:32.325
Although everybody understands, in the end of a day, everyone wants to win.

00:05:32.325 --> 00:05:37.075
Its been a big fest, it's like a thousand people who care about the same thing.

00:05:37.075 --> 00:05:40.000
Making cars drive themselves and they all get together.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.930
It's a big festival. It's really great.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.905
The largest team at the competition is from Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh.

00:05:54.905 --> 00:05:58.380
And for them the Grand Challenge is no love fest.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.330
But you're either, thoroughly rested, 200% effectiveness or you've got some work to do.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.900
No one knows what it takes to succeed in the Grand Challenge,

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.855
since no one anywhere has done it.

00:06:10.855 --> 00:06:14.835
The Red Team is prepared for anything.

00:06:14.835 --> 00:06:17.725
Led by former Marine, Red Whittaker,

00:06:17.725 --> 00:06:22.698
the Red Team is a well-funded army of computer wizards and engineers.

00:06:22.698 --> 00:06:25.050
The team has invested two years and

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.400
millions of dollars to get Sandstorm to the starting line.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.547
Ladies and gentlemen, from Pittsburgh, PH.

00:06:32.547 --> 00:06:33.750
This is a nice angle for the approach, get crisp, get crisp,

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:43.590
get crisp. Dang, beautiful.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:56.275
Sandstorm is aggressive on the straight away.

00:06:56.275 --> 00:07:03.782
But today, the robot has a fatal attraction to hay bales.

00:07:03.782 --> 00:07:07.435
Like all the entries,

00:07:07.435 --> 00:07:16.773
Sandstorm has four chances to demonstrate agility and speed for the judges.

00:07:16.773 --> 00:07:21.795
Based on their performance,

00:07:21.795 --> 00:07:24.595
20 robots will qualify for the main event,

00:07:24.595 --> 00:07:31.268
a long distance desert race and a chance to win $2 million.

00:07:31.268 --> 00:07:34.200
The race is sponsored by DARPA,

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.520
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.270
Their goal is to stimulate technology that can be used by the military.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.330
If we can use unmanned vehicles,

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.830
in dangerous missions like delivering supplies to frontlines.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:54.455
Then we can take drivers out of the vehicles and they're less vulnerable.

00:07:54.455 --> 00:07:57.095
If you remember Private Jessica Lynch,

00:07:57.095 --> 00:07:59.160
she was a driver of a supply vehicle.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.870
And if that was an autonomous vehicle that episode would've never happened.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.320
True Autonomy, that's what we're after. It's a hard problem.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.290
Just how hard a problem it

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:16.400
is to create a vehicle that can drive itself became painfully clear a year earlier,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.025
at the first Grand Challenge Race.

00:08:19.025 --> 00:08:22.900
Carnegie Mellon was one of 15 teams at the starting line.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:29.235
Racing against the clock,

00:08:29.235 --> 00:08:31.885
Sandstorm was the first robot out of the gate.

00:08:31.885 --> 00:08:35.550
To win, it had to run a course across 142 miles

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:41.455
of rugged desert terrain in less than 10 hours.

00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:48.980
But just seven miles from the start Sandstorm drifted off course and got stuck on a rock.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.940
In a valiant effort to keep moving,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:57.462
the robot spun its wheels until its tires burst into flame.

00:08:57.462 --> 00:09:00.465
Back at the start,

00:09:00.465 --> 00:09:03.670
other robots were having their own problems.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:08.375
Everything was set up for this high-speed rumble,

00:09:08.375 --> 00:09:12.260
of all these vehicles just careening through the desert.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.430
And that's not what happened.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:19.645
All 15 robots died of mechanical failure,

00:09:19.645 --> 00:09:22.530
half within the first mile.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.195
In this group of losers,

00:09:24.195 --> 00:09:26.140
Sandstorm went the farthest.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.895
Leading many to believe no robot could ever win the Grand Challenge.

00:09:30.895 --> 00:09:34.225
The fact that the vehicles only travel short distance,

00:09:34.225 --> 00:09:35.975
shows that it was a tough technical problem,

00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:38.680
but where the success really lies in

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.130
the amount of people that actually responded to the challenge.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:51.390
After this fiasco, Carnegie Mellon now has a year to prepare for the next race.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.730
Let's settle in. Go to work.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:59.070
The five main things that we said that we would get done for today, aren't done.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:05.840
So, it's not enough to wave hands and say, voila, this works.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.127
I signed up to succeed the Grand Challenge.

00:10:09.127 --> 00:10:14.660
This time around, the Red Team will be more like a Red Army.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.640
It is a machine to be reckoned with.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.075
Red Whittaker's resume is a veritable history of field robotics.

00:10:22.075 --> 00:10:24.410
His robots are battle hardened machines

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.275
built to clean up Three Mile Island and Chernobyl.

00:10:27.275 --> 00:10:30.650
These rust belt brutes can map dangerous mines,

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.490
load trucks, remove asbestos, and mow hay.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:41.950
They're global explorers that have ventured across volcanoes, deserts, and glaciers.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:50.770
Now, Whittaker has staked his reputation on winning the Grand Challenge.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.480
To double his chances,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.945
he's planning to run two robots in the next race.

00:10:55.945 --> 00:10:58.530
In addition to their veteran, Sandstorm,

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.390
the Red Team will transform this new Hummer into

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:05.987
a more aggressive machine called Highlander.

00:11:05.987 --> 00:11:07.480
For more than a year,

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.385
Wayt Gibbs has been documenting Whittaker's Grand Challenge quest.

00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:13.680
Red Whittaker is nothing,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.595
if not an ambitious man.

00:11:16.595 --> 00:11:18.305
He's a roboticist too,

00:11:18.305 --> 00:11:22.455
in his weekends goes out and drives a tractor for 10 hours on his farm.

00:11:22.455 --> 00:11:28.584
And who likes to actually get in and get his hands greasy and dirty inside an engine.

00:11:28.584 --> 00:11:33.890
Red gets excited about seeing his robots do powerful things in the real world.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.465
It's going work. The thing,

00:11:36.465 --> 00:11:38.440
with this stage of the game its making it,

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.540
making it work great make it work.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.670
You take that off.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:56.810
The Red Team will spend several months replacing and modifying Highlander's hardware.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:06.995
A tremendous amount of these desert racing machines is heavy metal, iron mongering.

00:12:06.995 --> 00:12:11.645
It's heating and beating and bashing and cutting, and making.

00:12:11.645 --> 00:12:15.860
It's as important as any of the software. And it's a lot of fun.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:21.130
To replace the human behind the wheel,

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.670
team members have installed an electromechanical system to steer,

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.505
shift, throttle, and brake.

00:12:27.505 --> 00:12:30.650
They're installing sensors, so Highlander can see.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:35.185
And GPS receivers, so it can follow the racecourse.

00:12:35.185 --> 00:12:39.140
And they're giving the robot a break and

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.805
filling it with software so it can drive by itself.

00:12:42.805 --> 00:12:47.505
Now, it might seem easy for robots to drive.

00:12:47.505 --> 00:12:49.880
It happens all the time in the movies.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.270
I'll drive.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.140
If you think of the Terminator movies,

00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:00.205
science-fiction has given us a really distorted view of the capabilities of robots.

00:13:00.205 --> 00:13:04.595
Those robots are able to identify specific individuals.

00:13:04.595 --> 00:13:09.610
But in reality, robots have very limited senses of perception.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:14.275
Robots know nothing about their environment and they can't think like humans.

00:13:14.275 --> 00:13:17.170
But they're really good at crunching numbers.

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:22.480
Most rely on laser rangefinders to perceive the world.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:30.010
Inside, a beam of light bounces off a spinning mirror and sweeps the terrain ahead.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:34.265
By measuring the time it takes a beam to hit something and return,

00:13:34.265 --> 00:13:38.690
the range finder can measure its distance from the vehicle.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:43.750
Scanners are mounted in pairs to measure different things.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.030
Some look for smooth road ahead,

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.585
others look for the road edge on each side.

00:13:49.585 --> 00:13:55.593
Some look for vertical objects - a rock or a fence post that can kill a robot.

00:13:55.593 --> 00:13:58.160
Putting it all together,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.890
this becomes Highlander's view of the world - A road map made from millions of

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:07.600
numbers that basically tells the robot bumpy or smooth.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:13.850
Off on its own,

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:19.360
Highlander will try to avoid obstacles for the first time.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:35.890
Improving its driving skills will take endless hours of programming.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:43.385
The Red Team robots have on the order of a million lines of computer code.

00:14:43.385 --> 00:14:47.660
Even so, they do very simple reasoning about the world.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.738
They look for flat spots. Flat is good.

00:14:49.738 --> 00:14:52.030
Drive on flat spots.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.570
Anything that's not flat, avoid it.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.530
But for the Red Team,

00:14:56.530 --> 00:15:00.590
winning the Grand Challenge involves much more than writing computer code.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:09.010
While some team members are testing Highlander in the field,

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:13.280
others are refurbishing Sandstorm.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.660
Another group is building state of the art sensors.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.420
And writing software never ends.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:27.360
Whittaker commands an army of 100 or more with a $3 million war chest.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:33.000
He's determined to have two robots at the starting line and one in the winner's circle.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.890
A lot of people work hard.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.905
Red Team's no exception on that front.

00:15:37.905 --> 00:15:39.790
Winning a race isn't about working hard.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:43.555
Yeah, you got to do that. But it's a lot more.

00:15:43.555 --> 00:15:47.060
If you haven't done everything, you haven't done a thing.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:54.540
Not all teams take Whittaker's all or nothing approach.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:59.270
For the Hall brothers, the Grand Challenge is great fun.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:04.380
Each day, Bruce and Dave program their robot as they drive into work.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.564
We have about a 45-minute drive each day.

00:16:07.564 --> 00:16:09.175
And we're tired of driving it.

00:16:09.175 --> 00:16:13.780
We'd like to get in to our vehicle and hit the switch and have it drive us home, frankly.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:19.866
The Hall brothers own a company that makes audio speakers.

00:16:19.866 --> 00:16:22.060
Bruce runs the daily business,

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:26.080
while Dave tinkers in the shop.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:33.210
Dave was the engineer and chief designer behind a new robot drive system.

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:38.230
And that enabled us to compete in robot competition, such as BattleBots.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.403
Great. These guys are from Silicon Valley.

00:16:40.403 --> 00:16:43.030
And they mean business. Look at this bad boy. How heavy is that?

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.750
350 pounds.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:52.400
We got second place in the world championship in Robot Wars.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.740
If you think about fighting robots where you're actually

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.785
controlling them through a remote control device,

00:16:57.785 --> 00:17:01.440
the next logical step is to have a vehicle that drives itself.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:08.095
Instead of lasers, the Hall brothers experimented with video cameras.

00:17:08.095 --> 00:17:10.690
Inspired by the way humans see,

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.910
the technique is called stereo vision.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:19.510
On the roof, they mounted two cameras side by side.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.890
By measuring the lateral shift of specific areas in each image,

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:26.500
the robot computes the distance of objects and

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.350
creates a difference map to avoid hitting them.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:39.120
Even after decades of research,

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.425
stereo vision is an unproven technology and at higher speeds,

00:17:43.425 --> 00:17:51.538
notoriously unreliable.

00:17:51.538 --> 00:17:55.280
After a few scares,

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:04.233
the Hall brothers scrapped stereo vision and started building their spinning laser.

00:18:04.233 --> 00:18:07.000
In the fields of Iowa,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.590
Team TerraMax is a group of defense contractors.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.210
Like all competitors, they're not allowed to use

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:16.263
government money to compete in the Grand Challenge.

00:18:16.263 --> 00:18:19.390
Still, for them, this is no hobby.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:24.670
Their vehicle is a big yellow goose that might lay a giant golden egg.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:28.060
TerraMax is a six-wheel drive vehicle.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.315
It is really the logistical backbone of the Marine Corps.

00:18:31.315 --> 00:18:36.100
And we think it's one of the most mobile vehicles in the world.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:40.438
Oshkosh has sold more than 6,000 of these trucks to the military.

00:18:40.438 --> 00:18:43.168
With the prowess of an Olympic athlete,

00:18:43.168 --> 00:18:44.604
it plunges into water,

00:18:44.604 --> 00:18:48.280
charges uphills, and even takes to the air.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.241
So, it's got the muscle.

00:18:50.241 --> 00:18:54.305
But what about the brains?

00:18:54.305 --> 00:19:02.306
Without a driver, TerraMax is more of a timid giant than a raging bull.

00:19:02.306 --> 00:19:06.435
But the team is confident of its future.

00:19:06.435 --> 00:19:09.480
In 10 years, the Pentagon plans to convert

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.385
one third of all military vehicles to unmanned operation,

00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:19.118
and Team TerraMax is very eager to help out.

00:19:19.118 --> 00:19:26.100
Making autonomous vehicles is a tough problem,

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.450
but apparently, not tough enough for Anthony Levandowski,

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:34.610
who is turning the Grand Challenge into a two-wheeled balancing act.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:40.150
A bike can do things that a truck and a car really can't do.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:45.935
You can do really sharp turns.

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:50.090
You can go through a forest, really tight spaces.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:54.740
The agility is just there that's not on other vehicles.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.500
Anthony dropped out of grad school at

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:03.880
UC Berkeley and spent two years teaching Ghostrider to stay up by itself.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.465
We're making a motorcycle the drives itself.

00:20:07.465 --> 00:20:09.261
Like can you get any cooler than that?

00:20:09.261 --> 00:20:13.555
That's why everybody on the team puts in so many hours,

00:20:13.555 --> 00:20:14.905
because when you see it work,

00:20:14.905 --> 00:20:17.260
you say, "wow, I made that."

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:25.400
A year earlier, at the first Grand Challenge,

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.660
Ghostrider made its world debut.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.830
I haven't slept in two days and I'm super excited.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.080
I mean, this is the culmination of six months worth of

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.225
work and I forget to turn on the stability.

00:20:41.225 --> 00:20:47.403
And then, the second I saw it start to fall and not steer, I said,

00:20:47.403 --> 00:20:50.752
"oh my god, I forgot to switch."

00:20:50.752 --> 00:20:53.070
That's life.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.485
You know, bad things happen,

00:20:54.485 --> 00:21:00.695
but this will never ever happen to me ever again.

00:21:00.695 --> 00:21:05.094
The Grand Challenge just basically takes up all of my life.

00:21:05.094 --> 00:21:07.115
Like, I don't really talk to my friends anymore.

00:21:07.115 --> 00:21:10.175
I don't have girlfriend right now.

00:21:10.175 --> 00:21:13.400
I say, I think it's totally worth it though.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.500
This could be a chance of a lifetime.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:24.880
Stanford University is a strong competitor

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.445
entering the Grand Challenge for the first time.

00:21:28.445 --> 00:21:33.230
I think the teams did great in the first time round and performed very well,

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.125
but it was obvious there were some missing links,

00:21:35.125 --> 00:21:37.505
some missing science to actually win this race.

00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:40.415
And these are the challenges I live for.

00:21:40.415 --> 00:21:41.680
That's why I do what I do.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.335
For almost eight years,

00:21:44.335 --> 00:21:48.275
Sebastian Thrun was Red Whittaker's colleague at Carnegie Mellon.

00:21:48.275 --> 00:21:50.650
They share a passion for robots,

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:53.365
but Thrun has little interest in hardware,

00:21:53.365 --> 00:21:57.130
and convinced Volkswagen to donate a vehicle with steering, brake,

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:02.145
and shift actuators that can be controlled by computer.

00:22:02.145 --> 00:22:04.090
The vehicle's name is Stanley.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.025
So, Stanley is nothing else but Stanford.

00:22:06.025 --> 00:22:08.735
But it also gives the vehicle a personality.

00:22:08.735 --> 00:22:14.150
We think of the vehicle more and more as an intelligent decision-maker.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:16.950
Thrun is a computer scientist with a deep interest in

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:21.160
machine learning and robots with personality are his specialty.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.870
His robots assist the elderly, conduct museum tours,

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.570
fetch tennis balls, and each one embodies

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:30.510
Thrun's desire to create machines that think.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:37.065
Sebastian Thrun is interested in the science of robotics,

00:22:37.065 --> 00:22:40.970
in learning about new techniques that can make

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.990
robots do fantastically advanced things 10,

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:47.245
20, even 50 years from now.

00:22:47.245 --> 00:22:50.720
I guess we've mounted them vertically but we have no data so far, right?

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.948
And we have no software that can do it?

00:22:51.948 --> 00:22:52.270
Yes.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.430
Okay, so how foolish of us.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.070
Compared to the Red team,

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:00.960
Stanford is a small group with a single focus on software.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.640
There's a good number of teams who think

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.495
the challenge lies in the hardware and God bless them,

00:23:06.495 --> 00:23:10.660
it's it's great they're doing this and I know there's hardware challenges.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.000
We from the very beginning pursued

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.900
a very aggressive timeline to focus almost entirely on software.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:25.120
Stanford uses the same laser hardware as the Red team but they're experimenting with ways

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.115
to use software to give their robot

00:23:27.115 --> 00:23:31.765
a greater role in making decisions about speed and safety.

00:23:31.765 --> 00:23:35.655
So in this display, the white area is safe to drive.

00:23:35.655 --> 00:23:39.610
The red area is unsafe to drive and they gray areas you don't know.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:43.120
And the robot then just has to steer itself so it stays in the middle

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.720
of the road and avoids this red stuff as much as possible.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:52.960
To test Stanley's software on the original race course,

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.290
the team has traveled to the Mojave Desert where the first Grand Challenge began.

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:03.330
Most of Stanley's computer code has been written by Mike Montemerlo,

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.930
Red Whittaker's former PhD student.

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:07.930
Give me steering and throttle.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:14.600
Steering is yours. Throttle. You're going. Great.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.905
Let's step to 15 now.

00:24:18.905 --> 00:24:22.210
What's the mile marker?

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:23.210
7.28.

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:24.730
7.3 is the critical place,

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:26.545
in fact right after this turn over here,

00:24:26.545 --> 00:24:32.380
the Red team rode off the road and that was its final destination in the race.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.110
That's a very exciting place for us,

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:35.790
it's in many ways a historical place because

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.420
it's the end of the previous Grand Challenge.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.113
Swerve to the right. Sorry.

00:24:39.113 --> 00:24:43.390
And we're having a problem.

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:46.000
That's the end of the race for us.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.640
Yes. What happened, Mike?

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:52.000
It just- the long lasers can't see.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.485
They're blind in the corner.

00:24:54.485 --> 00:24:58.330
We're stuck because of a software bug which we're currently debugging.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:03.851
So our challenge between April now and October will be to get rid of these bugs.

00:25:03.851 --> 00:25:07.400
Unbelievably,

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:12.370
Stanley faltered in the same place that killed the Red team in the first Grand Challenge.

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:18.185
But Thrun is confident about going head-to-head against a team he knows well.

00:25:18.185 --> 00:25:21.880
The Red team is a seasoned competitor and they have a lot of money,

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.760
a lot of equipment.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.515
They have a fantastic team.

00:25:25.515 --> 00:25:26.635
I used to be at Carnegie Mellon,

00:25:26.635 --> 00:25:30.445
I know Red very well, he's an amazing person.

00:25:30.445 --> 00:25:33.499
I wouldn't be surprised if the Red team and the Stanford team,

00:25:33.499 --> 00:25:37.210
and maybe two or three other teams were the big teams in the end.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:42.725
We'll see. It's a race, it's a true race.

00:25:42.725 --> 00:25:46.565
The Red team is teaching its robot to go fast,

00:25:46.565 --> 00:25:48.390
up to 50 miles an hour.

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:52.115
Software guru, Kevin Peterson,

00:25:52.115 --> 00:25:58.295
has been spending long days and nights improving Sandstorms performance at race pace.

00:25:58.295 --> 00:26:02.700
We've been working on Sandstorm for the last month.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.275
I just cut sleep out,

00:26:04.275 --> 00:26:07.350
it's not that tough.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.250
You get three hours of sleep a day, drink some coffee, you're okay.

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:16.355
As robot drives, it has to constantly update it's picture of the terrain ahead.

00:26:16.355 --> 00:26:19.320
The faster it goes, the faster it has to update

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.265
this picture or the terrain just gets on top of it.

00:26:22.265 --> 00:26:25.800
This is easy for humans to do because we can see out 300,

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.835
400, 500 feet ahead.

00:26:27.835 --> 00:26:33.105
But robots have sensors like lasers that operate at fixed ranges 60 feet,

00:26:33.105 --> 00:26:36.905
at most 150 feet.

00:26:36.905 --> 00:26:38.430
It's like driving through a fog.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:45.700
Each team must lift this fog to win the race.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:50.790
The Red team's secret weapon is hidden inside the dome on Sandstorm's roof,

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.390
where a high powered laser is mounted on a device called a gimbal.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:27:03.580
The gimbal is a motion platform that's a little bit like an animal's neck.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:08.255
It can point sensors left, right, up,

00:27:08.255 --> 00:27:16.860
down in such a way that the pounding motion from the vehicle is smooth.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:23.450
Like binoculars, this special laser can see into the far distance.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:26.080
By damping vibration, the gimbal gives it

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:31.430
a steady gaze and can point it to follow turns in the road.

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:35.700
The gimbal mounted laser is unique to the Red team,

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.205
which has made several from scratch.

00:27:38.205 --> 00:27:44.365
But it's a fancy piece of hardware that's hard to build and easy to break.

00:27:44.365 --> 00:27:47.620
There's been a lot of discussion whether you want to gimbal your sensors.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.170
In fact, we've actually decided against it.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.785
We decided against it because we wanted simplicity in the system.

00:27:53.785 --> 00:27:56.200
Every physical system that moves can break,

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:02.130
and there's a lot of stuff you can do in software.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.880
The Stanford team is putting its hopes in a set of

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:09.500
off-the-shelf lasers linked through software to a simple video camera.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:15.080
The camera can see all the way to the horizon.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.640
The trick is to give Stanley some way to distinguish the road in the video image.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.340
So this is just one laser. You can see it there steer the vehicle.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:27.875
Stanley's lasers pinpoint smooth terrain right in front of the vehicle.

00:28:27.875 --> 00:28:30.865
By overlapping the laser and video data,

00:28:30.865 --> 00:28:32.960
Stanley can identify the color of

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.950
the smooth area and search for it in the rest of the video image.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:42.945
The area Stanley believes is safe is now shown in red.

00:28:42.945 --> 00:28:46.405
By matching laser and video data on the fly,

00:28:46.405 --> 00:28:49.250
Stanley can adapt to changing road conditions and

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:52.310
determine safe driving speeds all by itself.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:58.425
Making a car really intelligent requires to give it an ability to adapt.

00:28:58.425 --> 00:28:59.905
It's just like in human life,

00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:04.250
we don't enable kids to have a rule for every contingency.

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.260
We tell them how to learn from contingencies

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.230
and make them smarter and then we trust them to learn.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:15.205
Stanford is the only team using adaptive vision to achieve ray speeds.

00:29:15.205 --> 00:29:19.830
Whether it will work well enough for the Grand Challenge will soon become clear.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:27.753
Back at the California Speedway

00:29:27.753 --> 00:29:30.790
after more than a year of fevered preparations,

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:32.645
the Grand Challenge is on.

00:29:32.645 --> 00:29:35.983
Officials from DARPA,

00:29:35.983 --> 00:29:39.365
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency

00:29:39.365 --> 00:29:42.865
are judging the final runs of the qualifying event.

00:29:42.865 --> 00:29:46.550
Forty-three teams are competing for just 20 slots in

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:52.410
the second and perhaps final Grand Challenge Desert Race.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:57.760
After failing three times to complete the two mile obstacle course,

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.790
Ghostrider is making its final attempt.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:08.160
It shows surprising agility until it enters the tunnel.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:15.390
It self-righted. Oops, no.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:19.860
Looking like a wounded animal,

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:24.155
it falls down and cannot get up.

00:30:24.155 --> 00:30:31.265
For Anthony Levandowski, the quest for the Grand Challenge is over.

00:30:31.265 --> 00:30:34.790
That was our chance and it was

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:43.086
unfortunate but that's life.

00:30:43.086 --> 00:30:47.130
Hey DAD! Are we there yet?

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:48.240
For the Hall brothers,

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.915
it's also the moment of truth.

00:30:51.915 --> 00:30:54.010
First obstacle, no problem.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.210
This is looking good. This is looking solid barring

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:58.480
any hardware issue I think we're going to make it.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.670
Coming up the other end. At opposite ends of the track,

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:04.980
The brothers Hall hold their breath as

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:08.950
their new laser sensor guides the truck along the course.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.450
Alright, let's see if this obstacle detection works.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:14.120
Here's the test.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:18.910
Did all the years of work pay off?

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:23.095
Turn you. Thank you. Right around.

00:31:23.095 --> 00:31:28.640
It's almost as though it was programmed to do that.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.500
You're now in the race. You're in the race.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.400
By finishing the course,

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.870
the Hall brothers have now earned a place in the main event.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:39.370
Booyah baby. You've got to love it.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:43.870
Ladies and gentlemen, TerraMax.

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:45.870
Team TerraMax

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:48.151
also qualifies for the race.

00:31:48.151 --> 00:31:49.160
Come give me some.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.160
Thank you, Jeff.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:56.150
Sandstorm's first run was not a dainty performance,

00:31:56.150 --> 00:32:02.285
but after the Red team recalibrates its lasers,

00:32:02.285 --> 00:32:07.020
the robot loses its appetite for hay.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:12.770
Sandstorm's younger sibling almost failed to make it to the start.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:16.670
Ten days earlier on a practice run,

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:22.260
Highlander swerved sharply and rolled on its roof.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:29.650
For the Red team's prized robot it looked like the end of the rope.

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:39.065
Lot 25 we've got Highlander in motion.

00:32:39.065 --> 00:32:45.990
Miraculously, Highlander is back in action though hardly tested.

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:52.990
First barrier.

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:55.750
It has a shaky start

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:57.610
but over the course of three runs,

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:03.960
Highlander clocks the fastest time of any robot at the qualifying.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.230
That thing's hauling.

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:20.120
That's more like it.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:29.550
A first time competitor Stanley is an unknown quantity.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.870
No one knows what to expect.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:39.280
The robot passes cleanly through the first gate.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.132
It shows impressive speed on the backstretch,

00:33:42.132 --> 00:33:45.149
but it's not as fast as Highlander.

00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:46.730
Like a proud parent,

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:50.170
Sebastian records the moment for posterity.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:52.870
Yes, so far so good.

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:56.775
Flawless.

00:33:56.775 --> 00:34:05.760
I don't see he has made a mistake at all. It's perfect.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.315
Aided by adaptive vision,

00:34:07.315 --> 00:34:09.450
Stanley is the only vehicle that

00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:18.415
never gets an obstacle.

00:34:18.415 --> 00:34:21.960
In 36 hours, the race,

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:25.310
the real Grand Challenge will begin.

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:29.900
DARPA announces who qualified and what the starting order will be.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:34.495
Highlander is number one on Saturday morning.

00:34:34.495 --> 00:34:40.790
Stanford number two on the pole position.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:46.180
And number three, Sandstorm.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:55.210
The race course is a circular maze that zigzags for

00:34:55.210 --> 00:35:01.325
132 miles across the Mojave desert near the outskirts of Las Vegas.

00:35:01.325 --> 00:35:04.833
It's mostly flat but rough and unpaved.

00:35:04.833 --> 00:35:09.830
It includes tunnels, cattle gates,

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:12.790
and steep mountain switchbacks.

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:14.585
With a 10-hour time limit,

00:35:14.585 --> 00:35:16.990
the race will demand speed, agility,

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:23.890
and endurance that no machine has ever demonstrated on its own.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:30.370
The exact route is a deeply guarded secret.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:35.350
But now, at 4:00 am on race day it's released to the team.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:41.875
On a compact disc is a road map defined by 2900 GPS waypoints.

00:35:41.875 --> 00:35:44.100
All your hopes and dreams are on this disc.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.750
Teams have two hours to analyze

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:52.563
the map and plug it into their robots before the race begins.

00:35:52.563 --> 00:35:57.580
In several minutes, the Stanford team loads the course into their robot.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:00.940
Stanley will choose its own speeds on the fly,

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:04.952
adapting to different types of terrain.

00:36:04.952 --> 00:36:09.020
The red team takes a far different approach.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.375
Concealed in their trailer,

00:36:11.375 --> 00:36:14.895
Whittaker's troops look like they're planning an attack.

00:36:14.895 --> 00:36:17.870
The race course is layered on top of

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:23.690
elevation data and satellite images stored in the red team's computers.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:27.660
The route is broken into sections and distributed

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:32.240
to team members who will examine it in minute detail.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:37.045
Thousands of waypoints are added to fill gaps in DARPA's map,

00:36:37.045 --> 00:36:41.325
and each point can be adjusted to optimize the robot's path.

00:36:41.325 --> 00:36:44.780
Speeds are set for every inch of terrain.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.965
Right where you are.

00:36:46.965 --> 00:36:48.608
Right where you are. Just zoom, zoom, zoom.

00:36:48.608 --> 00:36:50.420
Red believes his robots must have

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:55.200
as much information as possible to gain the winning edge.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:01.515
That preference is to air in the direction of overkill.

00:37:01.515 --> 00:37:04.490
I wouldn't want to reflect Sunday morning that we lowballed it

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:08.640
It is slow. It is flat. It is.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.310
On a course that appears easy,

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:15.030
Red makes a critical decision.

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.200
So here is the punch line.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.985
He decides to run Highlander at a fast and risky pace.

00:37:21.985 --> 00:37:23.970
Sandstorm will be the tortoise.

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:24.750
In the parking lot.

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:28.950
Running 40 minutes slower in the hope that at least one red team robot will finish.

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:34.950
The first time it's ever been done, autonomous vehicles.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:37.330
As dawn breaks over the desert,

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:44.619
robots prepare to boldly go where no robot has ever gone before.

00:37:44.619 --> 00:37:51.260
Vehicles will be launched at five-minute intervals and race against the clock.

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.012
as you can see, there will be an audible phone.

00:37:53.012 --> 00:37:55.028
Hey, Red.

00:37:55.028 --> 00:37:57.340
All the best.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:57.561
Hey.

00:37:57.561 --> 00:38:02.380
Very fun. Very good day.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:19.900
And we have auto-ball.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:24.990
Highlander leads the pack followed by Stanley and Sandstorm.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:27.780
And we have moving from Stanley.

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.780
Ladies and gentlemen. The start of the DARPA Grand Challenge

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:37.460
The cheering teams are now spectators.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:45.080
Their work is done. After months of tireless efforts, there's a lot at stake.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:45.523
And now Sandstorm.

00:38:45.523 --> 00:38:51.870
A vision they all shared will now be put to the test.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:57.380
You go.You go. You go.

00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:08.143
Highlander, Stanley, and Sandstorm.

00:39:10.143 --> 00:39:13.120
During the first eight miles of the race.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:20.544
Highlander gains two minutes on Stanley.

00:39:20.544 --> 00:39:23.610
At times, the Stanford robot

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:31.583
seems confused and disoriented.

00:39:31.583 --> 00:39:39.490
Sandstorm is keeping pace with Stanley, five minutes behind.

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:43.488
Launch of the sixth spot here. There. Are we there yet?

00:39:43.488 --> 00:39:52.390
It will take two hours to launch all the robots.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:55.040
Each one leaves the chute with confidence.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.715
A far cry from the first Grand Challenge with many faltering within sight

00:39:58.715 --> 00:40:04.255
of a start and no robot went beyond seven miles.

00:40:04.255 --> 00:40:05.820
The start of the race is pretty cool.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:09.775
It was really exciting to see all the robots go.

00:40:09.775 --> 00:40:11.525
I was excited and apprehensive.

00:40:11.525 --> 00:40:16.940
at the same time. You just don't know what's going to happen with a robot.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:21.630
It was entirely out of our hands.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:24.320
Far from the crowd,

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:32.414
Highlander now leads a fleet of driver-less machine racing the clock across the desert.

00:40:32.414 --> 00:40:36.280
Team DAD has passed two robots,

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:40.100
and is now heading to the front of the pack.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:47.934
Eight team robots have now passed the seven mile mark that ended the last race.

00:40:47.934 --> 00:40:54.595
Miraculously, the great team from New Orleans is holding its own,

00:40:54.595 --> 00:41:00.140
only weeks after the city was destroyed by hurricane Katrina.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:07.530
TerraMax was the last to start and brings up the rear.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:15.630
Following each robot, DARPA chase vehicles relay information back to the start.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:26.630
Here, teams gather around DARPA's displays.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:31.430
That's just pretty sweet. Throwing away in the front.

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.438
For throwing.

00:41:31.438 --> 00:41:31.439
For now.

00:41:31.439 --> 00:41:34.670
We're pulling away from DAD.

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:36.671
No, from Stanford.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:40.377
30 miles into the race,

00:41:40.377 --> 00:41:44.880
Highlander is making time on Stanley.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:54.863
Behind Stanley, Sandstorm is closing the gap and may pass the Stanford robot.

00:41:54.863 --> 00:42:01.150
behind them, robots are starting to drop like flies.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:08.481
At mile 26, team DAD's laser comes unbolted from the roof.

00:42:08.481 --> 00:42:11.790
Officials in the chase car hit the kill switch,

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:13.545
and for the Hall brothers,

00:42:13.545 --> 00:42:17.039
the race is over.

00:42:17.039 --> 00:42:19.050
At a media stop,

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:24.925
a group of journalists sees Highlander charging toward them in the distance.

00:42:24.925 --> 00:42:27.755
Highlander seemed to come down the hill very smartly.

00:42:27.755 --> 00:42:32.515
But then, as it started to mount the next hill,

00:42:32.515 --> 00:42:36.455
it looked like it ran out of gas,

00:42:36.455 --> 00:42:37.640
or the engine cut off,

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.410
or somebody in there threw it into neutral.

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:45.109
It just stopped moving and slid back down to the bottom of the hill.

00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:48.805
Something was wrong with Highlander,

00:42:48.805 --> 00:42:51.410
and it did not have its normal get up and go.

00:42:51.410 --> 00:43:00.411
Highlander keeps on rolling but cannot maintain its intended pace.

00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:07.485
Red and the team slowly realize that things are not going according to plan.

00:43:07.485 --> 00:43:10.329
I don't know whats going on with Highlander, it's weird.

00:43:10.329 --> 00:43:10.476
It's running slow.

00:43:10.476 --> 00:43:12.590
It's running real slow.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:24.500
Highlander struggles to summon the power to complete its mission.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:40.280
Behind it, Stanley is rapidly approaching.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:50.840
But Highlander recovers on the flats,

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:55.860
and for many miles they continue neck and neck.

00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:06.055
One hundred and two miles into the race,

00:44:06.055 --> 00:44:11.750
Stanley's video camera records a milestone event.

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:26.750
Stanley has passed Highlander.

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:44.078
At that point, we pretty much knew Highlander wasn't going to win the race,

00:44:44.078 --> 00:44:46.505
we thought Sandstorm might have a chance.

00:44:46.505 --> 00:44:51.653
It was really disappointing.

00:44:51.653 --> 00:44:54.660
Five hours after leaving the starting line,

00:44:54.660 --> 00:45:00.015
Stanely now leads the pack and just five robots remain on the course.

00:45:00.015 --> 00:45:04.440
To finish, they must wind through a treacherous mountain pass

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:10.040
and Stanley has now make life or death decisions.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:20.345
Somehow, Highlander has managed to reach the summit of the pass,

00:45:20.345 --> 00:45:24.395
but the gimbal is turned sideways and appears to be dead.

00:45:24.395 --> 00:45:26.740
Without its secret weapon,

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:34.285
must rely on short range lasers and GPS to avoid disaster.

00:45:34.285 --> 00:45:43.000
Right behind Highlander, Sandstorm is in good shape but driving slowly according to plan.

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:58.917
The crowd gathers.

00:45:58.917 --> 00:46:07.840
A blue dot appears in the distance.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.815
Yeah! Stanley!

00:46:09.815 --> 00:46:14.190
After driving six hours and 53 minutes,

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:17.140
at an average speed of 90 miles an hour,

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:21.420
Stanley is about to become the first vehicle in history to drive

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:37.084
132 miles by itself.

00:46:43.084 --> 00:46:47.265
Bot 25. Red team, two.

00:46:47.265 --> 00:46:49.206
Highlander from this Pittsburgh PA,

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:51.430
Carnegie Mellon University,

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:54.175
the red team two is an alliance.

00:46:54.175 --> 00:46:56.190
21 minutes behind Stanley,

00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:59.800
Highlander limps to the finish.

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:10.870
Minutes later, the trusty veteran appears

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:37.430
Bot number19.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:43.895
It was just amazing to see this community of people.

00:47:43.895 --> 00:47:47.235
That community succeeded today.

00:47:47.235 --> 00:47:50.190
Behind me, there are three robots that made it all the way through

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:53.575
the desert and all three of them did the unthinkable.

00:47:53.575 --> 00:47:56.450
It's such a fantastic success for this community.

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:58.872
I think we all win.

00:47:58.872 --> 00:48:02.330
Before announcing the winner,

00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:06.460
DARPA officials honor the five finishing teams.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:10.346
TerraMax is fifth.

00:48:10.346 --> 00:48:12.840
A dark horse,

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.291
the Gray Team from New Orleans, is fourth.

00:48:15.291 --> 00:48:21.683
Highlander is third.

00:48:21.683 --> 00:48:25.258
Sandstorm, Whittaker's tortoise,

00:48:25.258 --> 00:48:29.707
was just 11 minutes behind the winner.

00:48:29.707 --> 00:48:32.750
So, I guess it's time.

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:38.150
The check goes to Stanley.

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:44.150
So, someone from Stanley will please come up here.

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:47.370
What Stanford did in

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:53.255
a short span of time is amazing in the robotics world.

00:48:53.255 --> 00:48:57.640
On this scale of time to develop a system this sophisticated that can navigate

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:02.179
so well over such a wide variety of terrain at such high speeds,

00:49:02.179 --> 00:49:06.640
it really is worth its place in the history books.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.280
The source of Highlander's problems remains

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:16.443
a mystery that may have been the result of its rollover.

00:49:16.443 --> 00:49:20.205
The engine pump, the only thing that was

00:49:20.205 --> 00:49:24.720
short was not having a top end speed on the gas pedal.

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.450
Except for that, ran like a charm.

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:32.000
This really was like a horse race.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.765
It finished in such close times.

00:49:35.765 --> 00:49:45.065
So, the red team is justifiably proud for having both of its robots finished the course.

00:49:45.065 --> 00:49:49.440
Many believe the completion of the Grand Challenge is

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:54.990
a giant step that will push robots out of the lab and into the real world.

00:49:54.990 --> 00:50:01.926
The forces that will make this happen are embodied in the passion and vision of true men.

00:50:01.926 --> 00:50:06.740
The world needs both Sebastian Thrun's and Red Whittaker's.

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:11.210
If robotics is ever going to become part of the daily fabric of our lives,

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:14.210
it needs those scientists who can come up with those far out

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:17.869
ideas for how machines are actually going to start to think,

00:50:17.869 --> 00:50:24.045
to reason and it also needs the builders,

00:50:24.045 --> 00:50:29.185
the implementers, and those who are driven to make things work in the real world.

00:50:29.185 --> 00:50:32.830
There is every reason to believe all those who

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:36.130
participated will continue their quest to innovate even

00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:43.116
though the Grand Challenge itself is now history.

00:50:43.116 --> 00:50:46.870
What about the future?

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:53.170
Will mechanical warriors take over the battlefield?

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:59.045
Will we all be passengers on the highways of tomorrow?

00:50:59.045 --> 00:51:05.710
Someday, the great robot race may well be remembered as a moment when

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:13.510
the partnership between humans and the machines we create was forever changed.

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:30.025
