00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.990
I like to build, I like to write code,

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.250
I also like to sell.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.470
So basically I'm an entrepreneur.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.525
My name is Shai Magzimof,

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:10.930
I'm the CEO of Phantom Auto,

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.900
and I built Phantom Auto to provide a teleoperation service for driverless cars.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.770
Because I have three things that I love in my life,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.200
which is games, communication, and cars.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.795
Really what bothered me was transportation.

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:30.555
We all have this problem of commuting.

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:35.790
I thought that self-driving cars really solve the problem and my passion to cars,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.030
communication, and gaming, it just clicked to me.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.685
What happened basically as I was sitting in this simulation of racing cars,

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:48.995
with your VR headsets.

00:00:48.995 --> 00:00:52.490
I realized, wait a second,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.940
what if you can drive your real car from a virtual headset?

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.740
So you have a steering wheel and

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.465
pedals and if you move the steering wheel, you're moving the car.

00:01:02.465 --> 00:01:05.900
What could that be used for and that's where we came with the idea of

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.965
supporting autonomous vehicles and assisting when they need help.

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:13.670
So this is the remote operator console,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.810
is the way we control the car remotely over cellular signals.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.830
As you can see, I can have three screen showing me

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.795
180 degrees and I have a view of the interior to see the passengers and talk to them.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:28.100
All right. Good to go.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.540
So to take control of the car,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.525
I can turn on drive-by wire and once the car is on,

00:01:33.525 --> 00:01:36.440
you can see that any movement I put in to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.915
the steering wheel translates into movement in the car.

00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:43.700
Then Shai, since he's driving around hands-free,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.270
can take the time to send texts or email or

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.710
whatever and be productive member of society instead of sitting in his commute.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.230
You can see that Ben is moving the steering wheel,

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.060
the remote operator in real time.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.380
He also have a map with our GPS locations, so we can navigate.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.300
As I'm building a service,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.385
I hope to work with all the big companies that build these cars.

00:02:10.385 --> 00:02:14.100
Therefore Udacity was a great way to just jump

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.140
into this industry and learn the basics of how everything works and then write some code.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.080
So I actually practice it and see the challenges.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.130
Then right away start my own startup around it.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.070
Self-driving cars are really for me it's the next big thing.
