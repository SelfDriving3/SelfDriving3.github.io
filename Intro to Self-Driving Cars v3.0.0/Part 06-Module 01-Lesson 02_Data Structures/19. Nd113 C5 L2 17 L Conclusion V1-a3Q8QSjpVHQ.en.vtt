00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.770
Choosing a good data structure to solve

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.535
a hard problem actually requires you to do a lot of things well.

00:00:06.535 --> 00:00:08.925
First, you have to define the problem well.

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:12.510
Then, you have to understand the data structures you have available to you,

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.564
like lists, dictionaries and sets.

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:17.370
As well as their trade offs and their limitations.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.595
Then, you have to choose a good data structure to actually represent the problem,

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:24.899
so that you can then write a good algorithm that actually solves it. And that's a lot.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:28.349
And it takes a lot of practice before any of this becomes easy.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.435
As you continue through this narrow degree,

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:33.629
I really want to encourage you to actively think about the algorithms

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.876
you write and the data structures you're choosing to use.

00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:38.329
When you find yourself uncertain,

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.339
it's really helpful to talk about these things with other people.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.070
So, use the Noon Degrees Slide Channel, ask questions,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.109
and get involved in discussions about all the new concepts you're.
